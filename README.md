This is my first Java project and the idea of it is to simulate one ATP Championship season that includes season tournaments like Wimbledon, Italian open , Australian open , US open and so on.. and final ATP Finals tournament.
Text of a task is in this repo and its in Serbian.

Project is done using a NetBeans IDE and you can simply download the zip and import it using option File -> Import Project -> From ZIP. There is only one class with main function (AtpTour) and it represents the simulation of the project.

Key Topics covered : 
  1. Intro to Java.(User interaction on console)
  2. Open and read from files and parse information using token and split.
  3. Classes , Extending a class , Polymorphism , implementing an Interface and using Comparable for sorting
  4. HashMap, HashSet , ArrayLists
  5. Abstract classes and methods
  6. Randomization in Java
  7. Tennis knowledge :D
